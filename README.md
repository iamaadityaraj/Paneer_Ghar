# Overview
This Android project showcases a feature that lists dishes using **"RecyclerView"** and **"CardView"**. Each dish is represented as a card displaying an image, name, and description. The app includes a custom adapter (**"DishAdapter"**) to bind data to the views, and an **"onClick"** listener that displays a toast message with the selected dish's name.

## Features
 *  **RecyclerView Integration:** Smooth and efficient listing of items using RecyclerView.
 *  **Card View Layout:** Each dish is displayed in a visually appealing CardView.
 *  **Custom Adapter:** Bind the data into dish views.
 *  **Interactive UI:** Clicking on the dish display's a toast message with the dish name's.
 *  **Modern Android Components:**  Demonstrates the use of RecyclerView, CardView, and data binding for a clean and responsive user interface.
